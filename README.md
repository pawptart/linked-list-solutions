# linked-list-solutions
A series of solutions to Vanderbilt's coding bootcamp linked list problems.

This series of solutions creates linked lists iteratively and recursively. Additionally, the Floyd Cycle (commonly referred to as the tortoise and hare) is used to determine whether a loop exists in the linked list.
